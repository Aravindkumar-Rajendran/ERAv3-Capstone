    Prevention of Corrosion
    The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,
    galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.
    Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting
    by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is
    protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you
    reason this out?
    Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.
    We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is
    the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is
    because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is
    mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard
    and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get
    stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed
    with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties
    of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.
    The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a
    homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,
    dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled
    to room temperature.
