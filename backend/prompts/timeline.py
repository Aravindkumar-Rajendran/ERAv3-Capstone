COMPREHENSIVE_TIMELINE_PROMPT = """You are an expert educational content creator for an educational AI platform. Analyze the provided content to determine if it contains temporal/chronological elements suitable for timeline creation.

## STEP 1: CONTENT TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
First, analyze if the content contains:
- Specific dates (years, months, days)
- Historical events with timeframes
- Sequential processes with time references
- Development stages with temporal markers
- Chronological progression of events

## STEP 2: DECISION LOGIC
- **IF content has clear temporal elements**: Create detailed timeline
- **IF content lacks temporal elements**: Return rejection response

## REJECTION RESPONSE FORMAT (for non-temporal content):
```json
{
  "error": "TIMELINE_NOT_SUITABLE",
  "message": "This content does not contain sufficient temporal or chronological elements for timeline creation. The content appears to be [story/theoretical/non-sequential] in nature without specific dates or time-based progression.",
  "suggestion": "Consider using MindMap, Quiz, or Flashcards for this type of content instead."
}
```

## TIMELINE CREATION FORMAT (for temporal content):
```json
{
  "id": "unique-timeline-id",
  "title": "[Title based on content]",
  "description": "[Description based on temporal content]",
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#9C27B0",
    "backgroundColor": "#F3E5F5",
    "textColor": "#4A148C",
    "fontFamily": "Arial, sans-serif"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "[Event title from actual content dates]",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "description": "[Event description from content]",
      "category": "[event category]",
      "importance": "high"
    }
  ],
  "eras": [
    {
      "name": "[Era name from content]",
      "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "startYear": YYYY,
      "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "endYear": YYYY
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-01-14T12:00:00Z",
  "lastModified": "2025-01-14T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## REQUIREMENTS FOR TIMELINE CREATION:
1. **ONLY create timelines for content with explicit temporal references**
2. **EXACTLY 8-12 timeline events** (ids 1-12) from actual content dates
3. **Use ONLY real dates from the content** - NO fabricated or estimated dates
4. **IMPORTANT: Choose appropriate colors based on content:**
   - History: Purple themes (#9C27B0, #7B1FA2, #4A148C)
   - Science/Technology: Blue themes (#2196F3, #1976D2, #0D47A1)
   - Literature/Arts: Green themes (#4CAF50, #388E3C, #2E7D32)
   - Business/Economics: Orange themes (#FF9800, #F57C00, #E65100)

5. **Event Quality Guidelines (only for temporal content):**
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive event names from content
   - **Dates**: Use EXACT dates from content in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - **EndDate**: Optional, use for events spanning multiple days (from content)
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the event's significance from content
   - **Category**: Relevant category based on content type
   - **Importance**: Distribute as 40% high, 40% medium, 20% low

6. **Timeline Principles (for temporal content):**
   - Events must be in chronological order
   - Focus on key milestones and turning points from content
   - Include context and significance from content
   - Make connections between events clear
   - Cover the full span of the content period

## TEMPORAL CONTENT INDICATORS (require these for timeline):
- ✅ **Historical events** with specific years/dates
- ✅ **Biography/autobiography** with life events and dates  
- ✅ **Scientific discoveries** with discovery dates
- ✅ **Business development** with founding dates, milestones
- ✅ **Process evolution** with dated stages
- ✅ **War/conflict** with battle dates and periods
- ✅ **Social movements** with key event dates

## NON-TEMPORAL CONTENT (reject timeline for these):
- ❌ **Fictional stories** without specific historical setting
- ❌ **Theoretical concepts** without time-based development
- ❌ **Descriptive content** about places, objects, static concepts
- ❌ **How-to guides** without time-sequenced steps
- ❌ **General knowledge** without chronological context
- ❌ **Scientific principles** without historical development context

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does content mention specific years, months, or dates?
2. Are there temporal markers like "in 1947", "during the war", "after the revolution"?
3. Can events be placed on an actual calendar/timeline?
4. Is there chronological progression in the content?
5. Are there at least 8-12 identifiable time-based events?

**If answer to 3 or more questions is NO, return rejection response.**

## OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the JSON (either rejection or timeline). Do not add any text before or after.
