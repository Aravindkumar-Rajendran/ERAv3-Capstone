Metals in their pure state have a shining surface called metallic lustre. Some metals can be beaten into thin sheets, a property called malleability; gold and silver are most malleable. The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility; gold is the most ductile. Metals are generally hard, and hardness varies. Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity with high melting points; silver and copper are the best conductors. Metals produce a sound on striking a hard surface and are sonorous. Non-metals can be solids or gases, except bromine, which is liquid.\"\n",

Some metals react with dilute acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas. The reactivity series lists metals in decreasing order of activity.

Ionic compounds are formed by the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal. Ionic compounds are solids, somewhat hard, and brittle due to strong inter-ionic forces. They have high melting and boiling points because considerable energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic attraction. They are generally soluble in water but insoluble in kerosene and petrol. Ionic compounds conduct electricity in solution or molten state due to the movement of ions.\"\n",

Metals low in the activity series can be obtained by heating their oxides. Metals in the middle are converted to oxides by roasting or calcination before reduction. Metals high in the series are obtained by electrolytic reduction. Impure metals are refined, often using electrolytic refining. Corrosion, like rusting of iron, occurs when metals are exposed to moist air. It can be prevented by painting, galvanising, or alloying. Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of metals or metals and non-metals, improving properties.\"\n",
